# Pokepy ⚡

A Python project that simulates a simple Pokédex. You can create Pokémon, make them speak, and display their details — just like in the games!

## 🐍 What it Does

- Models Pokémon using a custom `Pokemon` class
- Lets each Pokémon "speak" its name
- Displays key Pokémon info like entry number, type, and description

## 📄 Example Output

Pikachu! Pikachu!
Entry Number: 25
Name: Pikachu
Type: Electric
Description: It has small electric sacs on both its cheeks. If threatened, it releases electric charges.

2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
